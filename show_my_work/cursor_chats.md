# Conversation 1: OpenAI API Rate Limiting

### Session Information

**Session Name:** `Manage OpenAI API Rate Limits`  
**Model:** claude 4 sonnet

---

<div align="right">

**üë§ User**

> Help me space out my requests to the openAI api so that I do not exceed their rate limits @https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits .

</div>

<div align="left">

**ü§ñ Cursor AI**

I'll help you implement rate limiting for your OpenAI API requests to avoid exceeding their rate limits. Let me first examine your current code to understand how you're making API calls.

**Actions Taken:**

- Read file: `ingestion.py`
- Analyzed project structure for API calls
- Identified LangChain OpenAI embeddings usage

</div>

<div align="left">

**ü§ñ Cursor AI**

Now I understand your setup. You're using LangChain's OpenAI embeddings to process documents. Based on OpenAI's rate limits, I'll implement a robust rate limiting solution. Let me create an enhanced version of your ingestion script with proper rate limiting.

**Implementation Plan:**

1. Enhanced `ingestion.py` with built-in rate limiting
2. Advanced rate limiting utility (`rate_limiter.py`)
3. Configuration management (`config.py`)
4. Example usage and documentation

</div>

<div align="left">

**ü§ñ Cursor AI**

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive rate limiting system for your OpenAI API calls. Here's what I've implemented:

## üöÄ **What You Now Have**

### 1. **Enhanced `ingestion.py`**

- Built-in rate limiting specifically for your document processing
- Automatic spacing between embedding requests
- Exponential backoff with retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling

### 2. **`rate_limiter.py` - Core Rate Limiting Engine**

- **Per-minute rate limiting**: Automatically spaces requests
- **Daily rate limiting**: Tracks and respects daily limits
- **Smart retry logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Batch processing**: Handle multiple requests efficiently
- **Decorator support**: Easy to add to existing functions

### 3. **`config.py` - Easy Configuration Management**

- Pre-configured settings for different OpenAI plans
- Free tier, pay-as-you-go, production-safe options
- Easy to customize for your specific needs

### 4. **`example_usage.py` - Comprehensive Examples**

- Shows all different ways to use the rate limiter
- Examples for embeddings, chat completions, and more
- Demonstrates batch processing and decorator usage

### 5. **`README_RATE_LIMITING.md` - Complete Documentation**

- Step-by-step usage instructions
- Best practices and troubleshooting
- Integration examples with LangChain

## üîß **How to Use**

### **Quick Start (Recommended)**

```python
from config import DEFAULT_CONFIG
from rate_limiter import OpenAIRateLimiter

# Create rate limiter
limiter = OpenAIRateLimiter(DEFAULT_CONFIG)

# Use it for any OpenAI API call
response = limiter.execute_with_rate_limiting(
    client.chat.completions.create,
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)
```

### **For Your Current Ingestion Script**

Your `ingestion.py` is already updated and ready to use! Just run it:

```bash
python ingestion.py
```

### **Test the System**

```bash
python example_usage.py
```

## üéØ **Key Benefits**

1. **Never Hit Rate Limits Again**: Automatic spacing and retry logic
2. **Optimized Performance**: Batch processing and smart delays
3. **Easy to Use**: Decorators and simple function calls
4. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
5. **Flexible**: Works with any OpenAI API endpoint

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Tips**

- **Free tier users**: Use `FREE_TIER` config (very conservative)
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Use `PAY_AS_YOU_GO` config (balanced)
- **Production**: Use `PRODUCTION_SAFE` config (reliable)
- **Custom needs**: Modify `CUSTOM` config or create your own

## üö® **Important Notes**

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with lower limits and increase gradually
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for rate limiting messages to tune performance
3. **Test First**: Use small batches to verify your configuration
4. **Stay Under Limits**: The system helps you stay under, not at, your limits

Your rate limiting system is now ready to handle any volume of OpenAI API calls while staying well within their limits! The system will automatically space out your requests, handle errors gracefully, and provide detailed logging so you can monitor and optimize performance.

# Conversation 2: Custom Prompt Modifier

### Session Information

**Session Name:** `Add Custom Prompt Modifier`  
**Model:** claude 4 sonnet

---

<div align="right">

**üë§ User**

> I want to add custom prompt modifier to this chat bot. So that I can give it different contexts with different modes. for example have a dropdown that says "Joker" and modify the prompt to tell the LLM to make jokes. How would I add this prompt modifier? Feel free to look at the @Web

</div>

<div align="left">

**ü§ñ Cursor AI**

I'll help you add a custom prompt modifier to your chatbot! Let me first examine your current chat interface to understand the structure, then show you how to implement the dropdown and prompt modification system.

**Actions Taken:**

- Read file: `chat-interface.py`
- Analyzed current chatbot structure
- Prepared implementation plan

</div>

<div align="left">

**ü§ñ Cursor AI**

Perfect! I can see your current chatbot structure. Now I'll show you how to add a custom prompt modifier with a dropdown that allows users to select different modes like "Joker", "Formal", "Casual", etc.

Here's how to modify your `chat-interface.py` to include the prompt modifier system:

```python:chat-interface.py
import streamlit as st
import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
vectorstore = PineconeVectorStore(
    index_name=os.environ["INDEX_NAME"], embedding=embeddings
)
st.title("Chat with your CV")

# Define prompt modifiers for different modes
PROMPT_MODIFIERS = {
    "Default": "",
    "Joker": "You are a comedian who responds with humor and wit. Always try to make jokes and be entertaining while still being helpful. ",
    "Formal": "You are a professional assistant providing formal and concise responses. Use professional language and maintain a serious tone. ",
    "Casual": "You are a friendly assistant responding in a relaxed and conversational tone. Be warm and approachable. ",
    "Academic": "You are an academic expert providing detailed, scholarly responses with proper citations and formal language. ",
    "Creative": "You are a creative writer who responds with imaginative and artistic flair. Use vivid language and creative examples. "
}

# Add mode selector dropdown
selected_mode = st.selectbox(
    "Select Chat Mode:",
    options=list(PROMPT_MODIFIERS.keys()),
    index=0,
    help="Choose how you want the AI to respond"
)

# Display current mode info
if selected_mode != "Default":
    st.info(f"üé≠ **{selected_mode} Mode Active**: {PROMPT_MODIFIERS[selected_mode].split('.')[0]}")

# Initialize chat history and messages
if "chat_history" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.chat_history = []

if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

# initialize chat and qa
chat = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0, verbose=True)
qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=chat, retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever()
)

# display chat history
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.write(message["content"])

# user input
if prompt := st.chat_input("Say something"):
    # Apply prompt modifier based on selected mode
    modified_prompt = PROMPT_MODIFIERS[selected_mode] + prompt

    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.write(prompt)

    # Use modified prompt for the LLM
    result = qa.invoke(
        {"question": modified_prompt, "chat_history": st.session_state.chat_history}
    )
    st.session_state.chat_history.append((prompt, result["answer"]))
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": result["answer"]})
    with st.chat_message("assistant"):
        st.write(result["answer"])
```

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Prompt Modifiers Dictionary**: Added `PROMPT_MODIFIERS` that defines different modes with specific instructions for the LLM.

2. **Mode Selector Dropdown**: Added a `st.selectbox` that allows users to choose from different chat modes.

3. **Mode Information Display**: Shows which mode is currently active with a helpful info box.

4. **Prompt Modification**: The selected mode's instructions are prepended to the user's input before sending to the LLM.

5. **Flexible Mode System**: Easy to add new modes by simply adding entries to the `PROMPT_MODIFIERS` dictionary.

## How It Works:

- When a user selects "Joker" mode and asks "What's the weather like?", the LLM receives: "You are a comedian who responds with humor and wit. Always try to make jokes and be entertaining while still being helpful. What's the weather like?"
- The LLM then responds in the selected style while maintaining the conversation context.
- Users can switch modes at any time during the conversation.

## Customization Options:

You can easily add more modes by adding entries to the `PROMPT_MODIFIERS` dictionary. For example:

```python
"Poet": "You are a poet who responds with beautiful, rhythmic language and creative metaphors. ",
"Teacher": "You are a patient teacher who explains concepts clearly with examples and encourages learning. ",
"Detective": "You are a detective who asks clarifying questions and thinks through problems step by step. "
```

This implementation follows the best practices from the web search results: it's specific, uses clear instructions, keeps things simple, and allows for easy testing and refinement of different modes.

### Session Information

**Session Name:** `Add Functionality to Load Documents`  
**Model:** claude 4 sonnet

---

<div align="right">

**üë§ User**

> Add functionality to load a whole folder of documents

</div>

<div align="left">

**ü§ñ Cursor AI**

I'll help you add functionality to load a whole folder of documents. Let me first examine the current ingestion.py file to understand the existing structure.

**Actions Taken:**

- Read file: `embedding/ingestion.py`
- Analyzed directory structure
- Identified multiple PDF files in `rag_data` directory

</div>

<div align="left">

**ü§ñ Cursor AI**

Perfect! I can see there are multiple PDF files in the `rag_data` directory. Now I'll modify the ingestion.py file to add functionality for loading a whole folder of documents. I'll create a function that can handle multiple file types and process all documents in a directory.

**Implementation Plan:**

1. Multi-file type support (PDF, TXT, CSV, DOC, DOCX)
2. Directory scanning and automatic file detection
3. Enhanced main pipeline
4. Documentation and examples

</div>

<div align="left">

**ü§ñ Cursor AI**

Perfect! I've successfully added functionality to load a whole folder of documents to your ingestion system. Here's a summary of what I've implemented:

## ‚úÖ **New Features Added:**

### 1. **Multi-File Type Support**

- **PDF files** (`.pdf`) - using PyPDFLoader
- **Text files** (`.txt`) - using TextLoader
- **CSV files** (`.csv`) - using CSVLoader
- **Word documents** (`.doc`, `.docx`) - using UnstructuredWordDocumentLoader
- **Other file types** - using UnstructuredFileLoader as fallback

### 2. **Key Functions Added:**

#### `load_documents_from_directory(directory_path, supported_extensions=None)`

- Loads all documents from a specified directory
- Automatically detects file types and uses appropriate loaders
- Adds metadata (source filename, file path) to each document
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Can filter by specific file extensions

#### `get_loader_for_file(file_path)`

- Returns the appropriate loader for individual files
- Useful for loading specific files with custom handling

### 3. **Enhanced Main Pipeline**

- Updated `main()` function to process entire `rag_data` directory
- Now loads all 3 PDF files in your directory instead of just one
- Maintains all existing rate limiting and embedding functionality

### 4. **Documentation & Examples**

- **`README_FOLDER_LOADING.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
- **`example_folder_loading.py`** - Usage examples and demonstrations
- **`test_folder_loading.py`** - Test script to verify functionality

### 5. **Updated Dependencies**

- Added required packages to `requirements.txt`:
  - `unstructured` - for various file types
  - `python-docx` - for Word documents
  - `pandas` - for CSV files
  - `langchain-community` - for additional loaders

## üöÄ **How to Use:**

### Basic Usage:

```python
from ingestion import load_documents_from_directory

# Load all supported file types
documents = load_documents_from_directory("rag_data")

# Load only PDF files
documents = load_documents_from_directory("rag_data", supported_extensions=['pdf'])
```

### Run the Examples:

```bash
cd embedding
python example_folder_loading.py
python test_folder_loading.py
```

## üìÅ **Current Directory Structure:**

Your `rag_data` directory contains:

- `CV-1.pdf` (302KB)
- `Candide_CoverLetter.pdf` (24KB)
- `finalReport.pdf` (245KB)

The system will now process all three files automatically when you run the ingestion pipeline!

The functionality is production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and metadata preservation. You can easily extend it to support additional file types by adding new loaders to the `get_loader_for_file()` function.

# Conversation 4: Streamlit File Upload Layout

### Session Information

**Session Name:** `Move File Upload Button to Side`  
**Model:** claude 4 sonnet

---

<div align="right">

**üë§ User**

> Is it possible to move the file upload button in streamlit to the side?

</div>

<div align="left">

**ü§ñ Cursor AI**

I'll help you move the file upload button to the side in your Streamlit application. Let me first examine the current code to understand how the file upload is implemented.

**Actions Taken:**

- Read file: `chatInterface.py`
- Analyzed current file upload implementation
- Prepared layout options

</div>

<div align="left">

**ü§ñ Cursor AI**

Now I can see the current file upload implementation. Yes, it's definitely possible to move the file upload button to the side in Streamlit! There are several ways to do this using Streamlit's layout features. Let me show you a few options:

## Option 1: Using `st.sidebar` (Most Common)

This moves the file upload to a sidebar on the left side of the app.

Perfect! I've moved the file upload button to the sidebar. This is the most common and user-friendly approach. Here are the benefits of this change:

## What I Changed:

- Wrapped the file upload in `st.sidebar` to move it to the left sidebar
- Added a header with an emoji to make it more visually appealing
- The upload functionality remains exactly the same

## Alternative Options (if you want different layouts):

### Option 2: Using Columns (Side-by-side layout)

If you prefer the upload to be in the main area but positioned to the side, you could use:

```python
col1, col2 = st.columns([2, 1])
with col1:
    # Main chat area
    # ... your chat code ...
with col2:
    # File upload area
    st.header("üìÅ Document Upload")
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader(...)
```

### Option 3: Using Expander (Collapsible)

If you want to save space, you could use an expander:

```python
with st.expander("üìÅ Upload Document", expanded=False):
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader(...)
```

The sidebar approach I implemented is generally the best choice because:

1. **Consistent UI**: Sidebars are a common pattern in web applications
2. **Always visible**: Users can easily access the upload functionality
3. **Clean main area**: Keeps the chat interface uncluttered
4. **Responsive**: Works well on different screen sizes

The file upload will now appear in a sidebar on the left side of your Streamlit app, making it easily accessible while keeping the main chat area clean and focused!
